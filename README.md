# Papers with Data
Data reigns supreme ðŸ¥‡. Every day it becomes more evident that *data* is the limiting factor for state-of-the-art ðŸ“ˆ machine learning. Your model architecture may be revolutionary, but without high-quality data ðŸ“Š, it will be doomed to mediocrity. Pair idea with execution and use top-notch data in your next project!

To make your life easier, we've combed through the **2359** papers accepted to CVPR in 2023 and compiled a short-list of papers introducing exciting new datasets.
